Besides that I was resposible for implementing and operating Golang based Kubernetes Operators and Microservices which support SAP Hana Cloud's Backup & Recovery services at a large scale.

  I am experienced in:

          To learn frontend development I adapted the project that it is completely build with Vue and TailwindCSS.
          It is a plain Single Page Application without any Backend functionality, and not the peak of software engineering.
          The main goal of this project for me was to build a modern website while learning new technologies.
